XmlHidden
=========

Introduction goes here.

hide attributes from being included in an xml output from every instance.
I didn't want to have to remember to use the same :except call everywhere.

Caveat: This works by overriding a serialization method. It is possible that it 
will affect other code that serializes out objects. It triggers on any serializer with xml
in its class name...

Example
=======

class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base

	attr_xml_hidden :id # id will not be part of the xml out
end
